# Tweeter Project :hatched_chick:

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

The starter code originated from the [original repository](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/tweeter) that this was forked from, then was built upon to practice HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.
