# Tweeter Project :hatched_chick:

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

The starter code originated from the [original repository](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/tweeter) that this was forked from, then was built upon to practice HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.

## Final Product

Upon clicking 'compose' button, form will appear to allow the user to enter a tweet. The app will then randomly generate a user and avatar and save the tweet to the Mongo database.
